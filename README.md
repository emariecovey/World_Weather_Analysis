# World_Weather_Analysis

This purpose of this analysis was to practice using apis to visualize weather data. I used the openweathermap api as well as the google directions api.



The Weather Database folder has two objectives:

1. Retrieve Weather Data: 

    Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map 

    Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.



The Vacation Itinerary folder has the following objective:

1. Create a Travel Itinerary Map 

    Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
